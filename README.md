# Madiyar Kenzhebayev — DAA Assignment 2

Topic: Kadane’s Algorithm (Divide and Conquer)

Overview:
Implemented Kadane’s Algorithm using divide and conquer. Added metric tracking, optimization, and benchmarking for performance analysis.

Algorithm:
Kadane’s Algorithm — finds the maximum subarray sum efficiently (O(n)), implemented with recursive performance evaluation.

Metrics:
Runtime, recursion depth, and performance comparisons with CSV export.

Analysis:
Experimental results confirm expected linear behavior with minor constant variations.

Testing:
Validated correctness on random and edge-case arrays; results match expected outputs.

Workflow:
Used feature branches, descriptive commits, and tagged final release v1.0.
